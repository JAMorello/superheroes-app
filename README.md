- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) to make `POST and `GET` requests
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) for the front-end of the app

- [Unresolved Issues](#unresolved-issues)

## How can I run the app locally?

1. Clone or download the source code from Github
2. Run `npm install` in the terminal to install the required dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to open a local host in the browser and run the React app
4. :exclamation: **Important:** Due to issues related to cross-origin requests, for the app running correctly, the user has to go to the [CORS everywere app](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo) and click on the button that says "Request temporary access to the demo server". **This will allow making successfull `GET` requests to the SuperHero API.**

## What will I see in the app?

#### Login

As long as the user is not logged in, will always see the Login page where he can enter his credentials. If the wrong inputs are entered, a warning message will popup.

#### Search

At the Seach page, apart of a search bar, when there are results of search (request to the SuperHero API), the hero cards will be displayed. The button may or may not be disabled and it will inform the user about the status: "Add" if the hero is available; "On Team" if the user already selected that hero; "Axis Filled" if there is already three heroes of the same allegiance in the team; and "Teamm Complete" if the team is composed of 6 heroes and have 3 heros of each posible allegiance.

If the user tries to go to any page that doesn't exist in the app, it will be redirected to a "Error 404: Page Not Foud" alert from where can go to the Home page or Search page.

## Unresolved Issues

- In the Home page, when having more than one team member, its easy to see that not all hero cards have the same height. It varies depending of image size and name lenght.
- It can be seen that the bottom of app, no matter in what page the user is on, have always a white stripe (thin or wide) except when in Search page with more than 4 hero cards.
- While in mobile, the hamburger menu button can't collapse once clicked and extended the menu.
